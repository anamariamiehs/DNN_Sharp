cube demo

AngularJS Test
Create a client-side single page web application for managing and visualizing daily events.
 
An event can be considered a meeting / appointment / note, with a timestamp, a title and a content.
The events should be stored client-side, by using a technique of your choice, so that they are available even if the browser is closed.
 
The application should allow managing these events – viewing, adding, editing, and removing them.
 
Visually, the application should be displayed on the layers of a cube by following this pattern:
·  Top layer of the cube serves as a view for adding events.
·  Bottom layer of the cube serves as a static view for displaying static information (about, support, copyright, etc.).
·  Side layers of the cube serve as means of showing the next 4 events in your calendar.
The cube should allow rotation via keystrokes (up, down, left, and right).
 
From a technical perspective, the calendar should work as a single-page application, loading necessary content when needed. It should be constructed with as much HTML5 and CSS3 functionality as possible. The entire application should be written in JavaScript, by using AngularJS as the framework for development.
 
Items to consider when developing the application:
·  Organizing your code
·  Having a clean architecture, with a good separation of concerns
·  Implementing a low coupling between components
·  Having a clean and consistent UI
